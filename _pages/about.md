Hi, I am Xueli Pan, a last-year PhD candidate in User Centric Data Science Group at VU Amsterdam.

My researches focus on knowledge graphs, semantic web technologies, and their applications in various domains, including health, nutrition, and mental health. My work integrates AI techniques, such as Large Language Models (LLMs), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), with cutting-edge knowledge representation methods to tackle complex questions in scholarly contexts. I aim to improve scientific discovery by integrating advanced NLP techniqes with semantic web technologies.
