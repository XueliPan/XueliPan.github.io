title: "Enhancing Scholarly Paper Recommendation by Modelling Diversity of Research Interests"
collection: publications
category: conferences
permalink: https://doi.org/10.1007/978-981-97-5934-7_16
excerpt: "This study enhances scholarly paper recommendation by introducing a feature that captures the diversity of a researcher's interests based on their past publications. Unlike existing weighting schemes that prioritize recent works, this approach considers content-wise relationships among papers. The feature is integrated into two weighting schemes and tested using Word2Vec text representations. Experiments on a dataset of 50 researchers show that while accuracy varies with parameters, optimal settings improve performance, as measured by NDCG@10 and P@10, compared to existing methods. This highlights the potential of diversity-aware interest modeling in scholarly recommender systems."

This study enhances scholarly paper recommendation by introducing a feature that captures the diversity of a researcher's interests based on their past publications. Unlike existing weighting schemes that prioritize recent works, this approach considers content-wise relationships among papers. The feature is integrated into two weighting schemes and tested using Word2Vec text representations. Experiments on a dataset of 50 researchers show that while accuracy varies with parameters, optimal settings improve performance, as measured by NDCG@10 and P@10, compared to existing methods. This highlights the potential of diversity-aware interest modeling in scholarly recommender systems.
