excerpt: 'This paper introduces a Semantic Web (SW) technology index to standardize development and evaluate the quality of SW applications across domains like medicine, finance, and geology. While SW technology has a general architecture, it lacks concrete guidelines for assessment. The proposed index consists of 10 criteria that quantify quality as a score, with detailed explanations of each criterion. Validation is conducted through case studies, demonstrating the index’s effectiveness. The study concludes that this index provides a valuable framework for guiding and assessing SW technology development, ensuring well-designed and high-quality implementations.'

This paper introduces a Semantic Web (SW) technology index to standardize development and evaluate the quality of SW applications across domains like medicine, finance, and geology. While SW technology has a general architecture, it lacks concrete guidelines for assessment.

Validation is conducted through case studies, demonstrating the index’s effectiveness. The study concludes that this index provides a valuable framework for guiding and assessing SW technology development, ensuring well-designed and high-quality implementations.
