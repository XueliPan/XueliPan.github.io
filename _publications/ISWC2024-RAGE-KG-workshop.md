excerpt: This study explores the use of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems in classifying column headers in tabular data, as part of the SemTab24 challenge. Seven Large Language Models (LLMs), including GPT models and open-source alternatives, were evaluated with different temperature settings. GPT models used OpenAI’s RAG system, while open-source models leveraged LLamaIndex. Findings highlight challenges in vectorizing data and the role of assistant instructions. Results indicate that input data significantly impacts RAG effectiveness, suggesting the need for tailored approaches for optimal performance. This work provides insights into the growing role of RAG in enhancing LLM capabilities."
