title: "Column Vocabulary Association (CVA): Semantic Interpretation of Dataless Tables"
collection: publications
category: conferences
permalink: https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-3889/paper2.pdf
excerpt: 'This study explores the Column Vocabulary Association (CVA) task in semantic table interpretation (STI) using only metadata. It evaluates several approaches, including Large Language Models (LLMs) with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and a SentenceBERT-based similarity method. In a zero-shot setting, LLMs perform well at lower temperatures, achieving 100% accuracy on the challenge test set. However, traditional methods outperform some LLMs when metadata and glossaries are closely related. Initial results on the full dataset suggest a 70% accuracy, indicating potential test set discrepancies that require further analysis.'
