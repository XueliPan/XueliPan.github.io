title: "Exploring the microbiota-gut-brain axis for mental disorders with knowledge graphs"
collection: publications
category: manuscripts
permalink: https://doi.org/10.2991/jaims.d.201208.001
excerpt: 'This study introduces MiKG, a knowledge graph designed to explore the microbiota-gut-brain (MGB) axis by integrating research on gut microbiota, neurotransmitters, and mental disorders. While these relationships have been widely studied, existing findings remain fragmented. MiKG systematically organizes decentralized research, enabling the identification of potential associations. It connects to biomedical ontologies such as UMLS, MeSH, KEGG, and SNOMED CT and is extendable for future integrations. MiKG provides a structured framework to investigate the influence of gut microbiota on mental health, offering a valuable tool for uncovering neurotransmitter-mediated pathways in brain-related diseases.'

This study introduces MiKG, a knowledge graph designed to explore the microbiota-gut-brain (MGB) axis by integrating research on gut microbiota, neurotransmitters, and mental disorders. While these relationships have been widely studied, existing findings remain fragmented. MiKG systematically organizes decentralized research, enabling the identification of potential associations. It connects to biomedical ontologies such as UMLS, MeSH, KEGG, and SNOMED CT and is extendable for future integrations. MiKG provides a structured framework to investigate the influence of gut microbiota on mental health, offering a valuable tool for uncovering neurotransmitter-mediated pathways in brain-related diseases.
